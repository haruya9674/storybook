<h2>🕊️ The Grateful Crane</h2>
<button onclick="speak()">🔊 Listen story</button>

<div class="story" id="story">
Long ago, a poor but kind man lived alone in a small village.

One cold winter day, he found a crane trapped in a hunter’s net.
The crane was injured and could not fly.
The man carefully freed the crane and let it go.

That night, a young woman came to his house.
She said she had nowhere to go, so the man welcomed her.

The woman worked hard and made beautiful cloth.
She sold the cloth, and they became less poor.

But the woman said one important thing.
“Please do not look inside the room while I am working.”

One day, the man became curious.
He quietly looked inside the room.

Inside, he saw a crane pulling out her own feathers.
The woman was the crane he had saved.

She looked sad and said goodbye.
Then she flew away and never returned.
