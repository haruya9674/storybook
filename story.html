<div class="story-box" id="story">
One sunny day, a rabbit met a turtle in the forest.
The rabbit was very fast and proud of himself.
The turtle was slow, but calm and kind.

The rabbit said, “You are too slow.”
The turtle smiled and said, “Let’s have a race.”

The race started.
The rabbit ran very fast and went far ahead.
He looked back and saw the turtle far behind.

“I have time,” said the rabbit.
He sat under a tree and fell asleep.

The turtle walked step by step.
He did not stop.
He passed the sleeping rabbit.

At the end, the turtle reached the finish line first.
The rabbit woke up and ran fast, but it was too late.

The turtle won the race.
Slow and steady wins the race.
